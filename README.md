Fashion Classifier
1. Designed and trained a convolutional neural network from scratch on the Fashion MNIST dataset to classify images of clothing items (T-shirt, dress, sneaker, etc.).
2. Implemented normalization techniques to improve model performance and accuracy.
3. Deployed the model using Streamlit, creating an interactive web app for users to upload images and receive real-time predictions.
4. Visualized prediction probabilities and evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics for better interpretability.
5. Gained hands-on experience with end-to-end Deep learning workflow, from data preparation and model building to deployment.
